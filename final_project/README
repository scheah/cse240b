CSE240B: Convolution Neural Network
Digital number recognition (MNIST dataset)



- How to run the CNN implementation on X86
1. Go to "bsg_cnn_sw" directory
2. Uncomment "BSG_X86_SIMUL" macro in "cnn_conf.h" file
3. Copy "Makefile.x86" to "Makefile"
4. Make and run "main"!



- How to run the CNN implementation on BSG manycore

1. Patch the bsg_manycore system verilog files (to use barrier function)
1.1 Find .v files in "../hw6_impl/v_hw_manycore_patch"
	and apply the changes in "bsg_manycore/v/"
1.2. See "WHATISTHIS" file in the same directory for more details

2. Patch the bsg_manycore_lib c header file (a small patch of the token queue for compile)
2.1 Find ".h" file in "./bsg_lib_patch"
	and apply the changes in "bsg_manycore/software/bsg_manycore_lib"

3. Change memory configuration of spmd to ensure sufficient memory space and execution cycles
3.1 Recommend to make backup for modified files :)
3.2 in "bsg_manycore/testbenches/basic/test_bsg_manycore.v", find and replace as follows:
`define MEM_SIZE   131072
`define BANK_SIZE  1024   // in words
`define BANK_NUM   32  
3.3 in "bsg_manycore/software/mk/Makefile.builddefs", find and replace as follows:
BSG_MANYCORE_BANKS=32
BSG_MANYCORE_BANKSIZE=4096
3.4 in "/home/student/cse240b/hw6/bsg_manycore/software/spmd/common/test.ld",
	find and replace as follows:
. = 0x10000;
3.5 Increase max cycles to a big number to avoid early program termination.
	Two ways are available:
3.5.1 Change MAX_CYCLES in "testbenches/basic/test_bsg_manycore.v"
3.5.2 Just remove a statement of "if (trace_count > max_cycles_p) begin ... end" from
	"testbenches/common/v/bsg_nonsynth_manycore_monitor.v"

4. Patch the testbench files of the bsg_manycore system verilog (to use weight loader)
4.1 Find two .v files in "./bsg_test_manycore_patch",
	and apply the changes in "testbenches/basic" and "testbenches/common/v".
4.2 The changes are marked by "CNN" comments.

5. Copy "bsg_cnn_sw" directory to "bsg_manycore/software/spmd"

6. Check that the "BSG_X86_SIMUL" macro is commented in "cnn_conf.h" file

7. Copy "Makefile.bsg" to "Makefile"

8. Make, then it runs "main!"


- How to intepret the result?
Using either IO(bsg) or printf (x86):
the program shows two values for two addresses at the end of the log, 
"00001000": The ground-truth value of the image defined in "test_input.c"
"00002000": The recognized digit value computed on CNN

Thus, they should be same if the CNN correctly recognizes.
+) In the integer test which uses "test_input_int.c" and artificially generated integer weights (i.e., make genweight),
the CNN should recognize the value by "9" through its computation.

- How to change the input files (images):
The image pixels are defined as an floating-point array.
There are five test_input files of images, and one of them can be selected using "run_input.sh" script.
In x86, we tested that the CNN can recognize their digits of all 5 files perfectly.
