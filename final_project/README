Digital number recognition (MNIST dataset)



- How to run the CNN implementation on X86
1. Go to "bsg_cnn_sw" directory
2. Uncomment "BSG_X86_SIMUL" macro in "cnn_conf.h" file
3. Copy "Makefile.x86" to "Makefile"
4. Make and run "main"!



- How to run the CNN implementation on BSG manycore

1. Patch the bsg_manycore system verilog files (to use barrier function)
1.1 Find .v files in "../hw6_impl/v_hw_manycore_patch"
	and apply the changes in "bsg_manycore/v/"
1.2. See "WHATISTHIS" file in the same directory for more details

2. Patch the bsg_manycore_lib c header file (a small patch of the token queue for compile)
2.1 Find ".h" file in "./bsg_lib_patch"
	and apply the changes in "bsg_manycore/software/bsg_manycore_lib"

3. Change memory configuration of spmd to ensure sufficient memory space
3.1 Recommend to make backup for modified files :)
3.2 in "bsg_manycore/testbenches/basic/test_bsg_manycore.v", find and replace as follows:
`define MEM_SIZE   131072
`define BANK_SIZE  1024   // in words
`define BANK_NUM   32  
3.3 in "bsg_manycore/software/mk/Makefile.builddefs", find and replace as follows:
BSG_MANYCORE_BANKS=32
BSG_MANYCORE_BANKSIZE=4096
3.4 in "/home/student/cse240b/hw6/bsg_manycore/software/spmd/common/test.ld",
	find and replace as follows:
. = 0x10000;

4. Copy "bsg_cnn_sw" directory to "bsg_manycore/software/spmd"

5. Check that the "BSG_X86_SIMUL" macro is commented in "cnn_conf.h" file

6. Copy "Makefile.bsg" to "Makefile"

7. Make, then it runs "main!"
